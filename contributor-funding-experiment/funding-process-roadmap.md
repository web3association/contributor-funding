# Funding process roadmap

The initial experiment is simple and easy to execute and should also be effective for gathering insightful data about how a contributor funding process could be operated. This experiment could lead to a range of different development focus areas for future iterations of this funding process. These focus areas have been aggregated together to create a rough roadmap to consider.



**Initial experiment**

The initial experiment focuses on trialling out some of the suggested approaches that emerged from the funding process analysis. This experiment will help to generate a large amount of data that can then be further analysed to make comparisons with other funding processes. The key components of this initial experiment include:

* **Contributor profiles** - Contributors will share personal and professional information about themselves to be considered as a candidate. Over time this will help with learning about what information is really necessary for votes to make a well informed decision when selecting contributors.
* **Contributor voter selection** - Expressive approval voting can be experimented with during the contributor selection process. This will help with learning about how easy it is to use this suggested voting system based on the voters feedback and the voting results data.
* **Contribution logs** - Individual monthly contribution logs can be trialled in this experiment to see how easy this approach is for contributors and how effective it is for recording and verifying contribution efforts. Over time this will help with identifying what contribution efforts can be recorded and presented. This experiment can also help with seeing how easy it is to identify good or poor performers based on their contribution logs and how accurate and limited this approach is for assessing overall performance.
* **Contribution attestations** - Attestations should be useful for the contributions that are not digitally recorded. Contributors can make requests to other people to submit attestations about their own contribution efforts so that there is more evidence that the contributor actually made a certain contribution. This process will be useful for learning about what kind of attestations people make about other people's contributions and how these contributions could be more easily recorded and verified in the future.
* **Peer review & feedback** - A simple feedback process will help to document peoples opinions and experiences about the other contributors that they worked with. Community members and other teams may also want to give feedback to the contributors who were funded. This information should be highly insightful for learning about how contributors have collaborated with others during the funding process and what impact they generated overall. This feedback should help with revealing some of the overall sentiments about the funding process and how it performed.



**Future development roadmap**

After the initial experiment is completed there are a number of focus areas to consider that can improve the contributor funding process. In a rough logical order of priority some of these focus areas could include:

* **Contributor profiles** - Identity solutions could help with making contributor profiles for storing and sharing personal and professional information about a contributor. Contributors would then be able to create their own identity profile which can showcase their contributions and involvement in a given ecosystem.
* **Contribution logs** - Contribution logs can be increasingly automated over time to make it easier and quicker for contributors to record and showcase their contribution outputs. Tools and libraries that are already being developed in the industry could be directly integrated into this contributor funding process.
* **Voting systems** - Voting systems can be developed or integrated into the funding process to replace any manual solutions that are currently being suggested for the initial funding experiment.
* **Contribution workflow** - Tools for managing and voting on how contributors work on a daily basis and make decisions about who works on what and how an idea gets executed.&#x20;
* **Contributor peer review & feedback** - Solutions for enabling contributors to review each other's performance and provide feedback to one another.
* **Community review & feedback** - Enabling community members to review and provide feedback to contributors whether that's about their performance or impact or just to share the gratitude they have about someone's contributions.
* **Idea coordination & discussion** - Systems that enable the community and contributors to better suggest, coordinate and discuss ideas that they could execute within the ecosystem.
* **Idea selection** - A voting solution that enables the community and contributors to share their opinions and preferences about which ideas they believe are the most promising to work on at that point in time.
* **Priority coordination & discussion** - Systems that enable the community and contributors to better suggest and discuss the priorities they believe are the most important for the ecosystem to focus on.
* **Priority selection** - A voting solution that enables the community and contributors to share their opinions and preferences about which priorities they believe are the most important for the ecosystem.
