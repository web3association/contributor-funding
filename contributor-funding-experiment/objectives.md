# Objectives

The overall goal of this contributor funding experiment is to generate more data and feedback about contributor funding to better understand how effective this funding process could be for Web3 ecosystems. The data and feedback generated by this experiment will be highly useful for analysing the differences between contributor funding and other funding processes. The experience gained will also help with identifying ideas about what the next steps would be for making a more effective funding process in subsequent experiments. The following objectives should help with achieving this goal.



**Collect contribution outcome data**

Each contributor can contribute towards a range of open source projects. These projects and contributions will all be open source. At the end of the experiment the final contribution outcomes can be aggregated. Comparisons can then be made about what has been produced and how this differs with the outcomes from other funding processes. Measuring this objective:

* Contribution log review - The contribution logs will point towards all of the contributions that each person has made and the different projects a contributor has collaborated with. These contributions can be aggregated together to understand what actual outcomes have been generated overall and how much collaboration has happened across the cohort of funded contributors.



**Collect individual contribution log data**

Individual monthly contribution logs represent a simple and potentially highly effective way for someone to record and verify contribution efforts. Contribution log data will help with making comparisons with other contribution verification approaches used in other funding processes to see which ones are most effective. Measuring this objective:

* Contribution log requirement - Contributors will be required to submit their contribution logs to provide evidence of the contributions they have made in that month. All contributions can be recorded publicly as all contribution outcomes must be open source. These contribution logs will be open source and available on a code repository for anyone to collect and review.
* Contributor feedback - Contributors will be asked to provide their feedback on the contribution log process when they complete their term as a funded contributor.



**Record voter and contributor participation time**

Data about how long it takes voters and contributors to participate in this experiment will be useful for making comparisons with other funding processes. For contributors it will be useful to know how long it takes them to write their proposal to be considered as a potential contributor. For voters it will be useful to know how long it takes them to read and select the most promising contributors during voting. Measuring this objective:

* Contributor feedback - Contributors will be asked to keep a record of how long they spend creating their proposal. A proposal submission feedback form will then help with capturing this information.
* Voter feedback - Voters will be asked to keep a record of how long they spent reading profiles and selecting contributors. A contributor selection process feedback form will then help with capturing this information.
* Average read and write times - Estimated read and write times can be determined by taking the total number of words there are in a contributor proposal and multiplying that by the average time it takes someone to write or read that amount of text. These values can then be compared against the average voter and contributor values provided.



**Collect expressive approval voting results data**

Expressive approval voting is an adaptation of approval voting that helps to increase the expressiveness of this voting approach. This suggested voting system can be used in the contributor funding experiment so that the voting results data can be analysed to see how people vote in practice. This will provide more evidence about how effective this approach is and whether it should be trialled in larger experiments. Measuring this objective:

* Voting process - Expressive approval voting will be used in this funding experiment. This voting system can be trialled using existing services and tools such as Google Form and Google Sheets. Anonymised voting data can be released to the public for review and analysis.
* Voter feedback - Voters will be asked to provide their feedback about the voting process when they complete the contributor selection decision process.



**Record voter and contributor opinions and preferences**

After the funding process experiment is completed the opinions and preferences of the contributors and voters involved can be recorded. For contributors it will be useful to know what they thought of the process, what they intend to do next and whether they prefer this funding process versus other approaches. For voters it will be useful to know what they thought of the process and whether they believe it was effective or not overall. Measuring this objective:

* Contributor feedback - Asking contributors about what they thought of the funding process, what their next steps are in the ecosystem and whether they preferred this funding process versus other approaches. This feedback should be useful for spotting any trends in what contributors think about the funding process and what they end up doing next after having that experience. Contributors may end up working with collaborators they met during the funding process or they might prefer to continue being a funded contributor in a future funding round.
* Contribution logs - Contribution logs will be useful for better understanding the experience of each contributor by reviewing what they have worked on during the experiment and what they thought of the process at the end. Contribution logs could help with discovering certain contributor behaviours that lead to certain outcomes and which behaviours led to generating more impact for the ecosystem.
* Voter feedback - Asking voters about what they thought of the funding process and how effective it was at generating impact for the ecosystem.
