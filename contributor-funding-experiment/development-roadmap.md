# Development roadmap

## **Initial experiment focus**

The initial experiment is entirely focused on learning as much as possible about operating a contributor funding process. This experiment will trail a number of the suggested approaches that emerged from the [funding process analysis](https://app.gitbook.com/o/jOQu4b6VLDxaQsg2rVwG/s/8L61e8ulVlk90t5mlQk1/) that will be highlighted below. Experimenting with many different approaches and keeping costs low will help with minimising the cost to learn about contributor funding processes. This experiment should help to generate a large amount of data that can be further analysed to make comparisons with other funding processes. The key components of this initial experiment include:

* **Community prioritisation suggestions** - A public priority suggestion board will help with experimenting with an independent priority system. This will be useful to see what priorities the community suggests and what they upvote over time. It will also be useful to see how contributors respond to these suggestions.
* **Simple idea system** - A simple task management board is a good starting point for exploring how an idea systems could be implemented. It would be useful to experiment with a more complete system in the future that enables contributors and community members to share draft ideas that can be improved over time more collaborative until they are ready for execution. For now a simple task management solution will suffice.
* **Contributor profiles** - Contributors will share personal and professional information about themselves to be considered as a candidate. Over time this will help with learning about what information is really necessary for votes when making an informed decision about which contributors could generate the most impact.
* **Contributor voter selection** - Expressive approval voting can be experimented with during the contributor selection process. This will help with learning about how easy it is to use this suggested voting system based on the voters feedback and the voting results data.
* **Contribution logs** - Individual monthly contribution logs can be trialled in this experiment to see how easy this approach is for contributors and how effective it is for recording and verifying contribution efforts. Over time this will help with identifying what contribution efforts can be recorded and presented. This experiment can also help with seeing how easy it is to identify good or poor performers based on their contribution logs and how accurate and limited this approach is for assessing overall performance.
* **Contribution attestations** - Attestations should be useful for the contributions that are not digitally recorded. Contributors can make requests to other people to submit attestations about their own contribution efforts so that there is more evidence that the contributor actually made a certain contribution. This process will be useful for learning about what kind of attestations people make about other people's contributions and how these contributions could be more easily recorded and verified in the future.
* **Peer review & feedback** - A simple feedback process will help to document peoples opinions and experiences about the other contributors that they worked with. Community members and other teams may also want to give feedback to the contributors who were funded. This information should be highly insightful for learning about how contributors have collaborated with others during the funding process and what impact they generated overall. This feedback should help with revealing some of the overall sentiments about the funding process and how it performed.



## **Future development ideas**

After the initial experiment is completed there will be a number of learnings that can be made by analysing the data that has been created and collected. These insights can help with guiding future experiments to continue learning about contributor funding. As effective approaches emerge the next step will be to start developing more complete solutions that incorporate the learnings from initial experiments. In a rough order of priority some of these potential areas of development could include:

* **Contributor profiles** - Identity solutions could help with making contributor profiles for storing and sharing personal and professional information about a contributor. Contributors would then be able to create their own identity profile which can showcase their contributions and involvement in a each ecosystem.
* **Contribution logs** - Contribution logs can be increasingly automated over time to make it easier and quicker for contributors to record and showcase their contribution outputs. Tools and libraries that are already being developed in the industry could be directly integrated into a contributor funding process to improve how contribution logs are recorded.
* **Voting systems** - Voting systems can be developed or integrated into the funding process to replace the manual solution that is initially being used for the experiment. The initial experiments should help to identify any improvements that might be necessary before a voting system is properly developed.
* **Contribution workflow** - Tools that help with managing and voting on how contributors work on a daily basis and make decisions about who works on what and how an idea gets executed.
* **Contributor peer review & feedback** - Solutions that help with enabling contributors and community members to more easily review other contributors performance and provide feedback about their contributions or interactions they've had with them.
* **Idea coordination & discussion** - Systems that enable the community and contributors to better suggest, coordinate and discuss ideas that they could execute within the ecosystem.
* **Idea selection** - A voting solution that enables the community and contributors to share their opinions and preferences about which ideas they believe are the most promising to work on at that point in time. Solutions that will improve upon the initial task management solutions used in this suggested experiment will be those that can help to take an idea from the draft stages all the way through to the execution stage in a collaborative manner.
* **Priority coordination & discussion** - Systems that enable the community and contributors to better suggest and discuss the priorities they believe are the most important for the ecosystem to focus on.
* **Priority selection** - A voting solution that enables the community and contributors to share their opinions and preferences about which priorities they believe are the most important for the ecosystem. The main problem with using solutions such as Canny is that these priority suggestions would not be on chain in. the ecosystem. Participating users might not necessarily be community members so future solutions will be more directly connected to the accounts and users in the ecosystem.
