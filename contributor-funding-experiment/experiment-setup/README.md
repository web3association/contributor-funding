# Experiment setup

This experiment is focused on exploring how effective an [open source contributor funding process](https://docs.contributors.org/proposal/open-source-contributors) could be for Web3 ecosystems. The following resources are intended to help with setting up this experiment.



**Contributor funding process overview**

The main steps involved in this funding process are as follows:

1. **Priority suggestions** - A priority suggestions board will be setup that enables community members to share their own suggestions about what open source initiatives could be the most important to work on. Community members can also upvote and comment on any existing suggestions.
2. **Contributor proposal submissions** - Community members are invited to submit contributor proposals with their personal and professional information. The community is invited to give feedback before these proposals are finalised.
3. **Voting process** - A voting process is setup so that voters can select the contributors they believe will generate the most impact for the ecosystem. The voting results are collected together and released to the public.
4. **Onboarding** - The successful contributors are then onboarded into the funding process and invited to join any of the chat channels that have been setup for communication. The contribution task board is setup and the initial tasks that contributors work on will be added.
5. **Monthly contribution period** - Contributors begin their monthly contributions and will keep a record of their contribution outcomes in a contribution log. At the end of the month the contribution logs of each contributor are checked and verified so that they can continue to receive future payments. Contributors will continuously update their contribution tasks with any progress that has been made and community members are also able to respond to any of these tasks with their own feedback.
6. **Completing the funding process** - Once the contributors have completed the funding round the community and contributors are asked to give the other contributors any peer review and feedback they might have. Voters and contributors are both then finally asked to give their feedback and opinion about the funding process overall.



**Experiment setup overview**

The [funding operator guide](templates/guides/funding-operator-guide.md) covers the main tasks and responsibilities involved in setting up and operating this contributor funding experiment. In regards to setting up the experiment as a funding operator the main tasks involved can be separated into three distinct phases:

1. **Priority suggestions setup** - A priority board should be setup first so that community suggestions can be shared. The priority suggestions will then be reviewed with the founding entities to assess whether there is a sufficient amount of impactful contribution areas to work on that justify the expense of funding some contributors to work on those areas.
2. **Proposal submissions setup** - If there are enough impactful contribution areas to work on the next step is to setup the proposal submission process so that community members can submit their proposals. The founding entities will then review these proposals to make a final decision about whether they want to continue the funding experiment based on the proposals submitted.
3. **Finalise funding process** - Once it is agreed that the funding process is going to continue and be executed the final step is to finish setting up any remaining tools and services and share the final funding process details with the community.



**Tech stack**

The following tools and services can be used for the funding process experiment. Founding entities can swap out these suggestions with other solutions that they prefer.

**Templates**

The following are some templates that can be used for setting up the funding experiment. This includes templates for guides, forms, questionnaires and Google Sheets.

**Approach & parameter decisions**

The founding entities will need to make a number of decisions about the approaches and parameter values it used for the funding process.&#x20;

**Time & cost estimates**

The total amount of time it takes for the community, contributors, voters and funding operator to participate in the funding process has been estimated. An estimated total cost has then also been applied.
