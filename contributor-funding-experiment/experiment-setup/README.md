# Experiment setup

The [funding operator guide](templates/guides/funding-operator-guide.md) goes through all of the main tasks and responsibilities involved in setting up and operating this contributor funding experiment. In regards to setting up the experiment the key tasks involved have been separated into three different phases:

1. **Priority suggestions setup** - A priority board should be setup first so that community suggestions can be shared. The priority suggestions will then be reviewed with the founding entities to assess whether there is a sufficient amount of impactful contribution areas to work on that justify the expense of funding some contributors to work on those areas.
2. **Proposal submissions setup** - If there are enough impactful contribution areas to work on the next step is to setup the proposal submission process so that community members can submit their proposals. The founding entities will then review these proposals to make a final decision about whether they want to continue the funding experiment based on the proposals submitted.
3. **Finalise funding process** - Once it is agreed that the funding process is going to continue and be executed the final step is to finish setting up any remaining tools and services and share he final information with the community.



**Tech stack**

The following tools and services can be used for the funding process experiment. Founding entities can swap out these suggestions with other solutions that they prefer.

**Time & cost estimates**

The total amount of time it takes for the community, contributors, voters and funding operator to participate in the funding process has been estimated. An estimated total cost has then also been applied.
