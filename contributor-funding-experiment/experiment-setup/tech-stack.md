  contributor funding experiment

# Tech stack

An experiment for contributor funding can be executed cheaply and easily using a combination of existing tools and services. The following is a list of the suggested tools and services that could be suitable for an initial experiment. Ecosystems can swap in any other tools and processes that they would prefer to use when running their own experiments.



[**GitHub**](https://github.com/)&#x20;

Most of the funding process information can be stored in an open source GitHub repository. This includes the guides, links to any tools being used, the contributor proposals and the contribution logs.



[**GitHub Projects**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)

GitHub projects can be used for the contribution board as this board would then be public and easily accessible in the same GitHub repository. This is simple and light weight solution that should be suitable for small experiments that only have a handful of contributors being funded.



[**GitBook**](https://www.gitbook.com/)

GitBook will be used to make all of the information stored about the funding process more presentable and easily traversable. Most community members will likely be viewing the funding process information using the GitBook interface.



[**Google Sheets**](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/)

Voters have a number of voting options that they need to choose from when casting a vote on each contributor. A Google Sheet voting form will capture those responses. To submit a completed voting form the voter would download the Google Sheet as a file and then upload that file to a Google Form for submission.



[**Google Forms**](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)

Google Forms will handle any questionnaires that will be shared throughout the funding process. A Google Form will also handle voting form submissions.



[**Canny**](https://canny.io/)

Canny will be used for handling priority suggestions from the community. Any community member can sign up using a social login to submit their own priority suggestions. Community members can comment on existing suggestions to give their feedback and also upvote any suggestions that they believe are the most important. Contributors will then take these suggestions into account when deciding how they should best spend their time to generate impact for the ecosystem.



[**Telegram**](https://telegram.org/)

Telegram will be used for the following conversations:

* Funding process chat - To answer any questions and concerns about the funding process
* Open contributor chat - To enable anyone in the community to give feedback and make suggestions about what the contributors are working on or to have any other relevant discussion.
* Internal contributor chat - For contributors to collaborate together and also communicate with the founding entities about their contributions, technical topics or other relevant topic areas.
