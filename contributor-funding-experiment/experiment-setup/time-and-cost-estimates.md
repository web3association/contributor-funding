# Time & cost estimates

Each of the stakeholders involved in the funding process have a list of tasks that they will complete to fully participate in the funding process. The time it takes to complete each of those tasks can be estimated and aggregated to generate a total estimated time required. The total time estimates can then be multiplied by an hourly rate for each role. Each role's hourly rate will need to roughly take into account the skill level and responsibility of the role. This will result in generating a total estimated cost to participate in the funding process for each stakeholder.



To create the participation time estimates a number of default parameters will be applied:

* **Contributor funding term length** - 6 months
* **Maximum funding available per contributor** - $60,000 (6 months of $10,000)
* **Total funding available** - $180,000 (A minimum of 3 contributors will get approved)



To create total participation cost estimates the following hourly rates will be applied to each of the different stakeholders:

* **Community member** - $15 per hour. This rate is higher than the majority of minimum wages across the world. The purpose of adding this rate is to help ensure that the value of people's time is respected.
* **Contributor** - $57.50 per hour. This is rounded down from a $120,000 annual equivalent salary assuming a 40 hour work week. This rate is higher than the majority of normal software developer roles across the world. It should be noted however that talented blockchain and smart contract developers can sometimes be paid much more than this hourly rate.
* **Voter** - $15 per hour. Same rationale as community members.
* **Funding operator** - $38 per hour. This is rounded down from a $80,000 annual equivalent salary assuming a 40 hour work week. The role is important however the tasks and responsibilities do not require a high skill level. The hourly rate should be comparable to a number of entry to mid level management or analyst roles depending on the country.



The values used within each stakeholder's time estimates are intended to reflect an average time. Some people will spend far longer than the estimated times given below, and others will spend far less time. Our goal for this estimation is to be somewhat generous in the average time estimations to better understand the potential cost if this process was going to be scaled.

Ecosystems can update any of the values being suggested to better reflect their own circumstances, usage and funding process. The values provided above are merely initial suggestions to start thinking about how time consuming and costly this funding process could be for the different stakeholders involved.
